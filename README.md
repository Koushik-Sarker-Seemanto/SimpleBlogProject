    Step 1 — Installing MongoDB

Ubuntu’s official package repositories include an up-to-date version of MongoDB, which means we can install the necessary packages using apt.

First, update the packages list to have the most recent version of the repository listings:

    sudo apt update

Now install the MongoDB package itself:

    sudo apt install -y mongodb

This command installs several packages containing the latest stable version of MongoDB, along with helpful management tools for the MongoDB server. The database server is automatically started after installation.
